## What does packaging means?

Packaging of an application, or a library, means that we are creating a compressed and executable file from our code.

## What is the purpose of packaging?

A packaged file is easy to distribute and run on different environments. It contains all the code you created, plus 
all the resources and dependencies needed to run your code.

## How to package Java code

The standard file format used to package java code is [JAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAR_(file_format)) which stands for Java ARchive.
In this module, we are going to use the `gradle` tool to create a java executable jar that contains all the dependencies.
