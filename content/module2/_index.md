This module aims to cover algorithms and data structures. 
We'll understand how to evaluate the complexities of an algorithms We'll look into specific data structures, their advantages, disadvantages, when you should use them and why.

### What we'll cover:
* [Complexity of Algorithms](1-evaluate-algoritm.md)
* [Data-structure](2-data-structures.md)
* [HashMap deep dive](3-hash-map-deep-dive.md)
