## Bash commands syntax

If you understand the basic syntax of bash commands, you can apply it to every command you run.

Every bash command follows this structure:

`command [options] [arguments]`

Please note that in the documentation, the square brackets `[]` mean optional. 
So what the above means, is that at a minimum bash is looking for a command, but `options` and `arguments` are optional.
