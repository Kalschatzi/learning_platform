## Java and OOP introduction

### Module Objectives

This is an introductory module to start understanding the key concepts of [Object Oriented Programming - OOP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-object-oriented-programming/).

We'll be using Java, as it's widely use, a run-everywhere language thanks to the [JVM](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/jvm-works-jvm-architecture/) portability. It's a somewhat verbose language which has positives and negatives - main positive as far as we're concerned is that it's a great introductory OOP language, very widely used, with loads of resources ready to use.

It will then cover basic algorithms and data structures. 
We'll understand how to evaluate the complexities of an algorithms We'll look into specific data structures, their advantages, disadvantages, when you should use them and why.

By learning the key concepts for it you'll be well on your way to understanding how most languages work.
