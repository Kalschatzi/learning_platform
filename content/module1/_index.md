## Module Objectives

This is an introductory module to start understanding the key concepts of [Object Oriented Programming - OOP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-object-oriented-programming/).

We'll be using Java, as it's widely use, a run-everywhere language thanks to the [JVM](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/jvm-works-jvm-architecture/) portability. It's a somewhat verbose language which has positives and negatives - main positive as far as we're concerned is that it's a great introductory OOP language, very widely used, with loads of resources ready to use.

By learning the key concepts for it you'll be well on your way to understanding how most languages work.

### What we'll cover:
* [Java Introduction](1-java-intro.md)
* [Encapsulation](2-java-encapsulation.md)
* [Inheritance](3-java-inheritance.md)
* [Polymorphism](4-java-polymorphism.md)
* [Unit Testing](5-java-unit-testing.md)
* [Comparing Object](6-java-comparing-objects.md)
